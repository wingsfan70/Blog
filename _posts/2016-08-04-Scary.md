I started this blog to express and write down thoughts and ideas that are running around in my head. The problem is that it is a very scaring situation for me.
I am an introvert. I have a very small close group of friends. I do not enjoy social situations with unknown people. 
I do not like feeling vulnerable and exposed. This is why doing this blog is going to be a big challenge for me.
It is going to force me to open up a bit and show myself to the world. I do feel that in the long run it will be good for me and make me a better person.
This blog will push me to take little steps outside my box. I am sure there are going to be ups and downs along this journey, but I feel I will grow as a human being by going through this.
