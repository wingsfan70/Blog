Today I would like to Thank [Travis Neilson](http://www.travisneilson.com) for inspiring me to make this step. 
In one of his [Podcasts](http://www.travandlos.com) he talks about how he feels everyone should be a publisher. 
This blog is going to be the start of my publishing on a regular basis.
I have been contemplating doing this for awhile now but never had the nerve to start. 
After many months of contemplation I decided to jump off the cliff and go for it.
