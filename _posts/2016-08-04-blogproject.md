I created this blog using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I used a theme from [JekyllThemes.io](https://jekyllthemes.io) desgined by Dirk Fabisch. 
The name of the theme is [Mediator](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/23502084/mediator). 
I used this theme because it was clean and well organized.
I used a theme instead of designing my own because I wanted to get this blog up and running as fast as possible. 
I will be working on my own unique theme in the future and plan on blogging about it
as I move along. 

I used Jekyll for this blog because I really enjoy the ease of use and deployment. 
I am still very new at using Jekyll but the more I use it the more I like it. You can quickly create a fully functional website in a very short time.
I find it very easy to learn. The bar to start using it is very low however this does not mean it lacks features. 
Using includes and layouts combined with the 'Front Matter', you can build some very intricate designs. Being that Jekyll is a static site generator,
the rendered site is very fast. 

There are some limitations though. The biggest one that I see is that since it is a static site there is no type of user login or database support.
