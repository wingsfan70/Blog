I really enjoy photography. I love catching that beautiful moment in time when something beautiful or awe inspiring happens. The subject of the majority of my pictures are inanimate objects or animals. I do not enjoy taking pictures of people. I get no satisfaction in posing people and hoping the picture I take is something that the person approves. I am not a professional photographer by any means. I have not even had any training in photography. I just do it as a hobby and to capture memories.
