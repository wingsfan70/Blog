This week I attended GitHub Patchwork event in Tampa. I really enjoyed it. When I went to this I was already familiar with Git.
The beauty about Patchwork is that they assume that you have no working knowledge of Git. There are several 
[demos](https://github.github.com/on-demand/) that are available which walk you through everything from the start. 
I focused on the Git command line tutorial just to get used to the commands.
I have used Git in the terminal before however I have to look up the commands each time I try to use them.
I thought I would share some of the things that I learned. One of the things that was always a bit unclear to me was the command
git push origin master. What confused me was the word origin. When I used git I primarily used it on my local machine so I never
really used the push command. I have recently started pushing my code up to GitHub. During the tutorial about using git on the command line,
it walked me through pushing code up to a remote host.

To add a new remote, use the git remote add command on the terminal, in the directory your repository is stored at.

The git remote add command takes two arguments:

A remote name, for example, origin
A remote URL, for example, https://github.com/user/repo.git
For example:

git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git
# Set a new remote

git remote -v
# Verify new remote
origin  https://github.com/user/repo.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/user/repo.git (push)


Explain setting up remote servers. (ie origin)
talk about the intorduction to open source vidoe (include link if possible)
Add links to Patchwork page
