This week I attended GitHub Patchwork event in Tampa. I really enojoyed it. When I went to this I was already familiar with Git.
The beauty about Pathcwork is that they assume that you have no working knowledge of Git. There are several demos that are available
which walk you through everything from the start. I focussed on the Git command line tutorial just to get used to the commands.
I have use Git in the terminal before however I have to look up the commands each time I try to use them.
I thought I would share some of the things that I learned.
Explain setting up remote servers. (ie origin)
talk about the intorduction to open source vidoe (include link if possible)
Add links to Patchwork page
